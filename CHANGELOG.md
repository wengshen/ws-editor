## NOTES

  The template manager now follow the same pattern as the other managers (e.g. `ws.templates.add`).

  *There's also changes to the way Highstock/Highcharts is loaded*
  If you need support for Highstock, Highcharts, and/or Highmaps, this now has to be explicitly included using the modules `highcharts-editor.module.highstock|highcharts.js`.
  Alternatively, build with the `complete` target which bundles all available modules as well as advanced mode into one source script.
